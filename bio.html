                I completed high school in Lexington Virginia, graduating with distinction in 2014. Afterward, I accepted a position with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://switch.tv">Switch Media</a> in Sydney, Australia, where I worked as a support engineer and server side programmer for a year. Switch Media is a multiplatform video company specialized in customized OTT solutions. I am now a Sophomore in Tufts University's School of Engineering, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship and Leadership studies. I continue to work on a contract basis for Switch Media, developing applications for the Roku streaming platform for the largest cable company in Australia. I am also a member of the Tufts Democrats Club and the Ultimate and Marathon Teams.
