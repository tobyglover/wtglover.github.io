                After graduating in 2014 from a rural high school in southwest Virginia, I took a gap year before college and worked as a support engineer and server-side programmer for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://switch.tv">Switch Media</a>, a multiplatform video company specialized in customized OTT solutions located in Sydney, Australia. I am now a Sophomore engineer at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship and Leadership studies. In my free time, I continue to work on a contract basis, developing applications for the Roku streaming platform for the largest cable company in Australia via Switch Media. I am also a member of the Tufts Democrats Club and the Ultimate and Marathon Teams.
