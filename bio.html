                After graduating in 2014 from a rural high school in Southwest Virginia, I took a gap year before college and worked as a support engineer and server-side programmer for <a href="https://switch.tv">Switch Media</a>, a multiplatform video company specialized in customized OTT solutions located in Sydney, Australia. I am now a Sophomore engineer at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship and Leadership studies.
